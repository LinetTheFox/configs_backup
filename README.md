A small repo I decided to do to save the configs and the WM + other minor apps sources that I got used to and would like to restore in case my system dies or migrating to a different PC.

Yes, mostly it is Suckless' stuff like dwm, st etc because I decided to try their software and ended up liking it too much. The repo is a bit messy still because for the most part it's just the source code of 5 programs and couple of Xorg configs smushed together, however it's free to use to anyone who wants... for whatever reason ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

TODO:
- actually test if it compiles and gets installed properly on a fresh system
- a normal script that will automatically place and install all the apps and place configs
